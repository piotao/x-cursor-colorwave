# x-cursor-colorwave
X-Window remake of win95 old animated cursor.

This a very long story, taking it's origins somewhen in 1995. I found an awesome mouse coursor for windoze 95, which was named 'Color Wave'. I think that the author was Eric Korbes, but I'm unsure. I started to love this coursor, but then I moved to Linux world entirely. For years I could not find any better and more clear coursor for my system, so I created it to mimic this one from windoze. So here it is. I hope no rights were harmed. This is a remake entirely drawn, by hand, by me. Programs used: GIMP.

This coursor works on Linux Mint with Cinnamon desktop. It should also work on any typical X-Window system. If not, please bug me with some report.
